    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Pakoras are a popular fritter from the Indian subcontinent. They're enjoyed as appetizers in Indian restaurants all over the world. Assorted vegetables, and occasionally fish and chicken, are coated in a chickpea-flour batter (also known as basan and gram flour) and fried. Pakoras are vegan, gluten-free, and surprisingly good for you—all that deep-frying aside.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Onion </li>
        <li>Eggplant</li>
        <li>Cauliflower </li>
        <li>Potato </li>
        <li>Okra </li>
        <li>Paneer </li>
        <li>Chillies</li>
        <li>etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, red pepper flakes, and cilantro, adding water until you have a smooth batter with a thick consistency. </li>
        <li>Add the cut vegetables to the batter, and stir well to coat. </li>
        <li>Heat a few inches of oil in a cast-iron pan over medium-high heat. Test for hot oil with a drop of batter; if it sizzles right away, it is ready. Drop ¼ cup-sized balls of pakora batter into the hot oil and fry the pakora a few minutes per side, rotating as needed, until pieces are golden brown and crisp.</li>
        <li>With a slotted spoon, transfer the pakoras to a plate or baking sheet lined with paper towels. Season with salt and serve with lemon wedges, mint and/or tamarind chutney, and ketchup. Eat them while they’re hot! </li>
    </ol>
